Not original code, just wanted to make a public repository for antigen

Original code found here:
https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2021/04/21/add-zsh-autocompletion-to-bitwarden-cli/

### Bitwarden CLI includes a structure for autocomplete but it doesn't work as well for me

https://github.com/bitwarden/cli/pull/137

## Installation

### Using Antigen

````shell
antigen bundle cupricreki/zsh-bw-autocomplete
````
